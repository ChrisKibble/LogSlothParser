# LogSloth Parser Attributes

Special thanks to some friends who helped me along the way.

- [Chris Dent](https://github.com/indented-automation) - Helped me solve a bunch of PowerShell issues
- [Kevin (PsychoData)](https://twitter.com/psychodata) - God of all things RegEx, was my sounding board more than once

The LogSlothParser HTML Export uses free and open source code from the following project, and we thank those developers:

- DataTables (https://datatables.net/)
- jQuery (https://jquery.com/)

And to [RegEx101](https://regex101.com/), where I spent a bunch time banging my head on the keyboard, but ultimately learning a lot.
