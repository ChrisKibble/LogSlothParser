# LogSloth Parser Attributes

Special thanks to some friends who helped me along the way.

- [Chris Dent](https://github.com/indented-automation) - Helped me solve a bunch of PowerShell issues
- [Kevin (PsychoData)](https://twitter.com/psychodata) - God of all things RegEx, was my sounding board more than once

And to [RegEx101](https://regex101.com/), where I spent a bunch time banging my head on the keyboard, but ultimately learning a lot.
